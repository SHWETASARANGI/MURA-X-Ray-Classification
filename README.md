# MURA-X-Ray-Classification
This project uses the MURA musculoskeletal X-ray dataset to detect key anatomical regions and classify each study as normal or abnormal. A two-stage pipeline first localizes the relevant area, then applies a focused classifier for improved accuracy. This approach enhances reliability and interpretability in automated radiograph analysis.
